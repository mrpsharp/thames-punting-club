Another year done. The 132nd Thames Punting Championships. The sun shone, the racing was fantastic. All in all a fabulous day at a beautiful course.

Great to see a few new faces again this year.

There are a few pictures already posted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1525715217451247.1073741830.306282322727882&type=1&l=8edd3ecf30) and will be a few more over the coming days, stay tuned.

And finally, thank you to all the helpers, course layers, competitors, spectators, the local residents and rowing club for making it such a superb event. Couldn't do it without you.
